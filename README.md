# Twitch-Streamer-Viewer
One of the harder beginner projects I created due to all the nesting and concatenation required.
The project is not responsive at all and the code is a mess. I'd be able to recreate it with ES6 and much better looking code much quicker than I'd be able to salvage this one.
I'm keeping it here to show the difference between my early projects and what I can do now so please don't laugh at the code.
